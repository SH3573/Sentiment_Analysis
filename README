In this assignment we will perform sentiment analysis using a few simple Neural Network based architectures. For this problem we use the IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset. The dataset contains 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for both train and test dataset, each with 12,500 positive (greater than equal to 7/10 rating) and 12,500 negative reviews(less than equal to 4/10 rating).

Part A: Construct this sequential model using Keras
Part B: Stacking Fully Connected Layers
Part C: Using LSTMS based networks
Part D: Adding Pre-trained Word Embeddings
Part E : Using Convolutional Networks
